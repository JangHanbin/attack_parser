{"title": "Runtime Data Manipulation", "descrption": "\nAdversaries may modify systems in order to manipulate the data as it is accessed and displayed to an end user.[1][2] By manipulating runtime data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making. Adversaries may alter application binaries used to display data in order to cause runtime manipulations. Adversaries may also conduct Change Default File Association and Masquerading to cause a similar effect. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.\n", "ID": "T1494", "Tactic": "Impact", "Platform": "Linux, macOS, Windows", "Permissions Required": "User, Administrator, root, SYSTEM", "Data Sources": "File monitoring, Process monitoring", "Impact Type": "Integrity", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "09 April 2019", "Last Modified": "18 July 2019", "references": [{"index": 1, "title": "FireEye.
