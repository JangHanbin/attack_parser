{"title": "Stored Data Manipulation", "descrption": "\nAdversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data at rest in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity. By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making. Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.\n", "ID": "T1492", "Tactic": "Impact", "Platform": "Linux, macOS, Windows", "Permissions Required": "User, Administrator, root, SYSTEM", "Data Sources": "Application logs, File monitoring", "Impact Type": "Integrity", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "09 April 2019", "Last Modified": "18 July 2019", "related": [{"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082", "Name": "APT38", "Description": "APT38 has used DYEPACK to create, delete, and alter records in databases used for SWIFT transactions.[1]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0085", "Name": "FIN4", "Description": "FIN4 has created rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to automatically delete emails containing words such as \"hacked,\" \"phish,\" and \"malware\" in a likely attempt to prevent organizations from communicating about their activities.[4]"}, {"Mitigation": "Encrypt Sensitive Information", "Description": "Consider encrypting important information to reduce an adversaries ability to perform tailored data modifications."}, {"Mitigation": "Remote Data Storage", "Description": "Consider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for taking regular data backups that can be used to restore organizational data.
