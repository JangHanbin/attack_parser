{"title": "Stored Data Manipulation", "descrption": "\nAdversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data at rest in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity.[1][2] By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making. Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.\n", "ID": "T1492", "Tactic": "Impact", "Platform": "Linux, macOS, Windows", "Permissions Required": "User, Administrator, root, SYSTEM", "Data Sources": "Application logs, File monitoring", "Impact Type": "Integrity", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "09 April 2019", "Last Modified": "18 July 2019", "references": [{"index": 1, "title": "FireEye.
