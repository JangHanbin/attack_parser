{"title": "Transmitted Data Manipulation", "descrption": "\nAdversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity. By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making. Manipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity deploy a tool that will intercept and change information. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.\n", "ID": "T1493", "Tactic": "Impact", "Platform": "Linux, macOS, Windows", "Permissions Required": "User, Administrator, root, SYSTEM", "Data Sources": "Packet capture, Network protocol analysis", "Impact Type": "Integrity", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "09 April 2019", "Last Modified": "20 June 2019", "related": [{"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082", "Name": "APT38", "Description": "APT38 has used DYEPACK to manipulate SWIFT messages en route to a printer.[1]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0395", "Name": "LightNeuron", "Description": "LightNeuron is capable of modifying email content, headers, and attachments during transit.[3]"}, {"Mitigation": "Encrypt Sensitive Information", "Description": "Encrypt all important data flows to reduce the impact of tailored modifications on data in transit."}]}
