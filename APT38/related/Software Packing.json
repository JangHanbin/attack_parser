{"title": "Software Packing", "descrption": "\nSoftware packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory.Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers. Example packers are MPRESS and UPX. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available,  but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.Adversaries may use virtual machine software protection as a form of software packing to protect their code. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.\n", "ID": "T1045", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platform": "Windows, macOS", "Data Sources": "Binary file metadata", "Defense Bypassed": "Signature-based detection, Anti-virus, Heuristic detection", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-570", "Contributors": "Filip Kafka, ESET", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "31 May 2017", "Last Modified": "26 September 2019", "related": [{"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "Name": "APT29", "Description": "APT29 used UPX to pack files.[26]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022", "Name": "APT3", "Description": "APT3 has been known to pack their tools.[28]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082", "Name": "APT38", "Description": "APT38 has used several code packing methods such as Themida, Enigma, VMProtect, and Obsidium, to pack their implants.[29]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0087", "Name": "APT39", "Description": "APT39 has repacked a modified version of Mimikatz to thwart anti-virus detection.[33]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0373", "Name": "Astaroth", "Description": "Astaroth uses a software packer called Pe123\\RPolyCryptor.[18]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020", "Name": "China Chopper", "Description": "China Chopper's client component is packed with UPX.[21]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0070", "Name": "Dark Caracal", "Description": "Dark Caracal has used UPX to pack Bandook.[30]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0334", "Name": "DarkComet", "Description": "DarkComet has the option to compress its payload using UPX or MPRESS.[16]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0187", "Name": "Daserf", "Description": "A version of Daserf uses the MPRESS packer.[5]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0066", "Name": "Elderwood", "Description": "Elderwood has packed malware payloads before delivery to victims.[25]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0367", "Name": "Emotet", "Description": "Emotet has used custom packers to protect its payloads.[17]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0182", "Name": "FinFisher", "Description": "A FinFisher variant uses a custom packer.[14][15]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0342", "Name": "GreyEnergy", "Description": "GreyEnergy is packed for obfuscation.[11]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0043", "Name": "Group5", "Description": "Group5 packed an executable by base64 encoding the PE file and breaking it up into numerous lines.[31]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0132", "Name": "H1N1", "Description": "H1N1 uses a custom packing algorithm.[3]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0283", "Name": "jRAT", "Description": "jRAT payloads have been packed.[22]"}, {"link": "https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0409", "Name": "Machete", "Description": "Machete has been packed with NSIS.
