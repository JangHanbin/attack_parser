{"title": "APT37", "descrption": "\nAPT37 is a suspected North Korean cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2012. The group has targeted victims primarily in South Korea, but also in Japan, Vietnam, Russia, Nepal, China, India, Romania, Kuwait, and other parts of the Middle East. APT37 has also been linked to following campaigns between 2016-2018: Operation Daybreak, Operation Erebus, Golden Time, Evil New Year, Are you Happy?, FreeMilk, Northern Korean Human Rights, and Evil New Year 2018. [1] [2] [3]\nNorth Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and the name Lazarus Group is known to encompass a broad range of activity. Some organizations use the name Lazarus Group to refer to any activity attributed to North Korea.[4] Some organizations track North Korean clusters or groups such as Bluenoroff,[5] APT37, and APT38 separately, while other organizations may track some activity associated with those group names by the name Lazarus Group.\n", "ID": "G0067", "Associated Groups": "ScarCruft, Reaper, Group123, TEMP.Reaper", "Contributors": "Valerii Marchuk, Cybersecurity Help s.r.o.", "Version": "1.3", "Created": "18 April 2018", "Last Modified": "04 October 2019", "references": [{"index": 1, "title": "FireEye.
