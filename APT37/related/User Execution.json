{"title": "User Execution", "descrption": "\nAn adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. This may be direct code execution, such as when a user opens a malicious executable delivered via Spearphishing Attachment with the icon and apparent extension of a document file. It also may lead to other execution techniques, such as when a user clicks on a link delivered via Spearphishing Link that leads to exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via Exploitation for Client Execution. Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl. As an example, an adversary may weaponize Windows Shortcut Files (.lnk) to bait a user into clicking to execute the malicious payload.[1] A malicious .lnk file may contain PowerShell commands. Payloads may be included into the .lnk file itself, or be downloaded from a remote server.[2][3] While User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it.\n", "ID": "T1204", "Tactic": "Execution", "Platform": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Data Sources": "Anti-virus, Process command-line parameters, Process monitoring", "Contributors": "Oleg Skulkin, Group-IB", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "18 April 2018", "Last Modified": "21 June 2019", "references": [{"index": 1, "title": "Proofpoint Staff.
